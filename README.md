## What is this game about?
Hit It Right is a score oriented mobile game also it is the first game I created on Unity and published on Google Play.

## How the game works?
### Movements
* Movements are really basic.
* There are two different non-visible buttons on the screen. One is on right and the other one is on the left.
  - Left button controls the ball up and down
  - Right button controls the ball left and right

### Scoring and Gameplay
* Each time players hit a colorful brick/wall with the ball that matches with ball's color, players get 1 point.
* After hitting the correct brick/wall, ball's and brick's color change.
* If players hit the wall with the ball that doesn't match with the ball's color, game will be over.
