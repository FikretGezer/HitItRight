## What is this game about?
Hit It Right is a score oriented mobile game also it is the first game I created on Unity and published on Google Play.

## How the game works?
### Movements
* Movements are really basic.
* There are two non-visible buttons on the screen: one on the right and the other on the left;
  - The left button controls the ball's up and down movements.
  - The right button controls the ball's left and right movements.

### Scoring and Gameplay
* Each time players hit a colorful brick or wall with the ball that matches the ball's color, players earn 1 point.
* After hitting the correct brick or wall, both the ball's and the brick's color change.
* If players hit the wall with the ball that doesn't match the ball's color, the game will be over.
